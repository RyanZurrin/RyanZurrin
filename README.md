### Hi there, I am a Computer Science student and ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of Python, C++, Java and C programming. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [my own personal website](https://www.ryanzurrin.com) as well I am a Undergraduate Machine Psychology Fellow at UMass Boston doing research on breast canceer detection using machine learning. I have a good amount of experience with using Python, C++, and my googling skills are top notch. I love all things related to programming, problem solving, learning, and enjoy building algorithms and API's that help achive less complexity for users and clients. ðŸ’¬Ask me about programming problems on leetcode or Hackerrank and I would love to help you solve some of htese problems too. I thrive on my school projects and homework and always aim for getting A's. I am looking to find an internship where I will be able to apply what I have learned in a more professional setting within the softeware industry. I am a great communicator with high ambition and have a strong motivating presence that will push a team to do its best. I look forward to continuing my path and learning more and more as I grow into my role as software developer over the years.ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ“« You can reach me if you are interested in collabortaing or finding out more, via email at ryanzurrin@ryanzurrin.com.
