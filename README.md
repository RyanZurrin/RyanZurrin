### Hello, üëã I'm Ryan Zurrin, 

A driven Computer Science student set to graduate soon from the University of Massachusetts, Boston with a B.S. in Computer Science. I have honed my skills in various programming languages including Python, C++, Java, and C, with an emphasis on crafting effective, user-friendly solutions. I possess an instinctive knack for problem-solving, and an enduring passion for programming, algorithms, and API development.

üí° As an Undergraduate Machine Psychology Fellow at UMass Boston, I delved into the world of machine learning, focusing on research that aids in breast cancer detection. My role at the Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory (PNL) at Brigham and Women's Hospital has further elevated my expertise in the industry. Here, I am actively involved in building neuroimage preprocessing, processing, and harmonization pipelines. I routinely work with advanced tools and technologies, such as AWS and Docker, gaining real-world insights into data management and cloud computing.

üåê In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I've also been directing my efforts toward building my personal website and constantly refining my coding abilities. I strongly believe in the power of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with emerging trends and technologies.

üë• I'm not only a coder, but also an effective communicator and a motivated team player. Thriving in collaborative environments, I aspire to bring a dynamic, inspiring presence to any team. Presently, I'm working full-time at the Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory (PNL) at Brigham and Women's Hospital, continually deepening my understanding of the medical imaging software industry. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the convergence of fields such as AI and Machine Learning with medical imaging. I see immense potential for these technologies to revolutionize the industry, and I am eager to contribute to this cutting-edge intersection of tech and healthcare.

üìö Have a tricky programming problem from LeetCode or Hackerrank? Feel free to ask! I revel in the challenge and the opportunity to help others on their coding journey.

üì¨ I am open to collaborations, professional opportunities, or just a good tech discussion. Reach out to me via email at ryanzurrin@ryanzurrin.com.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I look forward to connecting with you and embarking on rewarding coding adventures together!
